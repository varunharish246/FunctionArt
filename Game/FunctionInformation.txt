General knowledge:
-f(x) reflects the function across the x axis.
f(-x) reflects the function across the y axis.
a f(x) stretches or shrinks the function by 'a' units vertically.
f(1/a x) stretches or shrinks the function by 'a' units horizontally.
f(x) + a moves the function 'a' units vertically . Up if 'a' is positive down if 'a' is negative.
f(x+a) moves the function 'a' units horizontally. left if 'a' is positive right if 'a' is negative.

NOTE:f(-x+a) = f(-(x-a)), f(bx+a) = f(b(x+a/b))

Linear Function:

Formula: y = mx +b
Linear functions are straight lines, made from the parent function f(x) = x. They can be tilted 
by the coefficient m this is called slope. The variable b is used to move the function through the graph.

Quadratic Function:

Quadratic functions are made from the parent function f(x) = x². The parent quadratic function
squares the input, so the output can't be negative because (-)² = +. The y values increase 
exponentially making a 'U' shape

Cubic Function:  

Cubic functions are made from the parent function f(x) = x³. The parent quadratic function
cubes the input, so unlike a quadratic function there can be negative values.

Absolute Function:

Absolute functions are  made from the parent function f(x) = |x|. They are the same as linear functions
except the negative x values become positive y values giving them the appearance of a 'V'

Reciprocal Function:

Reciprocal functions are  made from the parent function f(x) = 1/x. The y values become greater
as the x values become smaller, when the x values is less than 1 the y values become greater than the 
x values. This is why the parent function is approaching zero, but can't reach zero because 1/0 
is undefined.

Sin function

Sin functions are made from the parent function f(x) = sin(x). The sin operation is used on an angle of a
right triangle to find the side opposite to the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.
Since angles only go up to 360 degrees, or 2π radians the parent function repeats itself after 
the value becomes greater than those numbers. For example, 361 degrees will be treated as 1 degree. Since 
the function repeats itself one 360 degree cycle of the parent function is called a period.
