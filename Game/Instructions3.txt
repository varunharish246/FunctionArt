1. If the timer runs out before you graphed the highlighted function you will be taken to a question page

2. Based on what parts of the function you answered incorrectly (type of function, domain, shifts) you will be asked a question to help you better understand the part you are stuck on

3. If you answer the question correctly the panel will turn green, if not it will turn red.

4. You have to answer the question to get back to the graphing page or else the "Back" button won't work.
